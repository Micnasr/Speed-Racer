# Speed Racer :fire:	
An arcade racing game where you can choose to play between three modes:
* 2 Players :racing_car:	:racing_car:	
* 2 Players Timed Fuel Mode :racing_car::fuelpump::racing_car:	
* Singleplayer VS A.I. :racing_car: :robot:	

I am very much aware that the game has very weird driving physics. It was the first time messing around with car physics on the engine and I learned so much from this project.

<p>I created the game in a week using the Unity3D engine in June 2020.</p>
